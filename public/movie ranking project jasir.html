<p>Although this is not a movie but a show, i mentioned it none the less because is my all-time favorite TV Show, it shows the daily strugle of some "science nerds" with social interactions with a little bit of humor, I personally felt attached to it because I coul relate to the characters esspeially the main Character "Sheldon Cooper".</p>
